# BlinkYourStory
Alessandro Esposito Vulgo Gigante 

_Swift Playground for the Swift Student Challenge 2024_

# Description:

**Blink Your Story** is specifically designed for children and teaches them the fundamentals of story telling.
The aim is to provide a tool that enables children with mobility issues to write a story with the aid of their imagination and eye control.
The application works by recognizing as commands the blinking of the right or left eye.
Become the writer of your personal story!

Note: This playground needs to run on an Ipad with camera access to detect the blink of the right and the left eye.
